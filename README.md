Bachelors thesis project practical part. 

Thesis theme: 'Classification of blood cell images with the purpouse of diagnosing AML'

Practical part included implementing a convolutional neural network, and I chose to do this using a minimum of external libraries.
Using only numpy, PIL and Python built in libraries, I used this task to gain a better understanding of neural networks and their training, 
data pipelines and image processing.

The project is, because it was made to learn-on-the-go, chaotic and did yield any sucessfull results.
Code does not apply the standards in ML community, and the operations in the CNN are not implemented to maximize their efficiency, but to simply understand what goes on inside the convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers.

Branch to look at: refactor
